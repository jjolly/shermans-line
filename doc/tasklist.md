# Sherman's Line Visualization: Task List

## Project Plan

- [x] Set up Rust project and add dependencies (`eframe`, `egui`)
- [x] Create main application window using `eframe`
- [x] Implement triangle with draggable vertices
- [x] Compute and draw:
    - [x] Incircle
    - [x] Circumcircle
    - [x] Nine-point circle
    - [ ] Sherman's line
- [ ] Display linear equations for the circles/lines
- [ ] Implement UI toggles for auxiliary constructions:
    - [ ] Show altitudes (perpendiculars)
    - [ ] Show ortho-center-vertex segments
    - [ ] Show side midpoints
    - [ ] Show feet of altitudes
    - [ ] Show midpoints of orthocenter-vertex segments
- [ ] (Optional) Add save/load functionality for triangle state
- [ ] (Optional) Polish UI, add controls, help, etc.

### Notes
- The project uses `egui`/`eframe` for cross-platform GUI (desktop and web-ready).
- Each step will be explained with rationale and alternatives.
- This document will be updated as the project progresses.
